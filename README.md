# Introduction to Task Scheduling Approaches for Cloud Computing

 Cloud computing has become an integral part of modern technology, providing
 scalable and flexible resources for various applications. One of the key
 challenges in cloud computing is e cient task scheduling, which involves
 allocating tasks to virtual machines (VMs) in a way that optimizes resource
 utilization and meets performance requirements.
 In recent years, researchers have focused on developing scheduling heuristics
 that aim to achieve load balancing, scheduling optimization, and energy-aware
 resource/task scheduling. These heuristics play a crucial role in improving the
 e ciency and profitability of cloud resources.
 The Need for Task Scheduling Heuristics
 Task scheduling in cloud computing is the process of e ciently assigning
 computing tasks and workloads to available resources within a cloud
 infrastructure. The Task Scheduling Problem is NP Hard in NAture. They help in
 reducing downtime, improving response time, and ensuring that tasks are
 executed in a timely manner. Additionally, these heuristics enable load
 balancing, which distributes tasks e ciently across the cloud, preventing
 resource overload and underutilization.
 State-of-the-Art Scheduling Algorithms
 Min-Min Algorithm:
 The Min-Min task scheduling algorithm minimizes the makespan by assigning
 the smallest task to the earliest available machine in a distributed computing
 environment.
 First Come First Serve:
 The First Come First Serve (FCFS) task scheduling algorithm allocates tasks to
 available resources in the order they arrive, without considering their execution
 time or priority.
 Round Robin:
 The Round Robin task scheduling algorithm allocates tasks to available
 resources in a circular order, each receiving a fixed time slice, promoting
 fairness in execution.
Shortest Job First:
 The Shortest Job First (SJF) task scheduling algorithm assigns tasks to
 available resources based on their execution time, favoring the shortest jobs
 f
 irst.
 Enhanced Max-Min Algorithm:
 The approach is as follows: initially the task with maximum burst time is
 executed first then tasks with minimum burst time is selected for execution till
 the summation of their burst time is less than or equal to the burst time of task
 that has been executed recently. This procedure continues till every task in the
 meta- task set is executed completely.
 Maximum Completion Time (MCT) Algorithm:
 Maximum Completion Time task scheduling algorithm prioritizes tasks based
 on their maximum expected completion times, aiming to minimize overall job
 completion time.
 Su arage:
 The Su rage Time task scheduling algorithm assigns tasks to resources by
 considering the di erence between their remaining execution time and the
 execution time of the second most capable resource, aiming to balance the
 load.
 Task Aware Scheduling Algorithm:
 Task Aware Scheduling is an approach that considers the specific
 characteristics and requirements of each task to optimize their allocation to
 resources in a computing system for improved performance and e ciency. It
 alternates between Min-Min and Su arage Algorithm to achieve this result.
 Resource Aware Scheduling Algorithm:
 Resource-Aware Scheduling is an approach that considers the availability and
 capabilities of resources in a computing system to optimize the allocation of
 tasks, promoting e cient resource utilization. It alternates between Min-Min
 and Max-Min Algorithm to achieve this result.
